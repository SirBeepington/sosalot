# Decoupling tool definition text from code

- MCP servers advertise tools, their capabilities and usage in tool definitions, which are requested by and then sent to the MCP client
- By default, the docstring for each tool is sent as the tool definition
- This is a PITA when it comes to tweaking/testing the definitions, hard to version, rollback, A/B test
- So I want to keep the definitions in a separate JSON manifest file 'tool_definitions.json'
